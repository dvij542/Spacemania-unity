In this part of space , meteors are cotrolled by aliens.Your job is to inspect each and every region of this part of space so as to transit information about this part of space back Earth. Once travelled the whole part ,You should exit the region through a secret gate that shall appear after you have travelled through the whole region.
Yellow coloured dots represent the places that you have not travelled.
Be aware of the meteors that shall destroy your spaceship if they hit it. The movement of meteors is controlled by the aliens hence once the meteors have sought you they shall follow all along your way. One way of getting rid of these meteors is by firing at them but the storage space for bullets in your spaceship is limited . Also, once fired , it takes 15 second for the new bullet to be loaded into the ship .
Also, the aliens shall continously respawn the meteors so as to destroy your spaceship.
Your job is to tranverse through all the places of this reign and then escape.
